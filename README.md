## 👋 About Me

Hi! I'm **Aravind**, a passionate B.Tech student on a serious mission to **master computer science** from the ground up. I'm not just learning theory — I believe in **building real projects**, solving real problems, and tracking everything I do publicly on GitHub.

### 🎯 My Mission
To go from beginner to professional by learning step by step, staying consistent, and building a portfolio that shows skill, discipline, and growth.

### 🛠️ What I'm Focused On
- **Programming Languages**: C++, Java (OOP, Problem Solving)
- **Development**:Software Development, Android apps (XML, Firebase), basic web development
- **Core CS Concepts**: DSA, OOP, Git & GitHub
- **Project Building**: Sharing everything I build — clean, real, and open source

### 📚 How I Learn
I don’t chase shortcuts. I prefer:
- Clear, structured explanations
- Hands-on coding
- Real-world application
- Continuous improvement through feedback
